#Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore some techniques in supervised learning. It is important to realize that understanding an algorithm or technique requires understanding how it behaves under a variety of circumstances.

#Implementing Five Learning Algorithms:

  * Decision trees with some form of pruning
  * Neural networks
  * Boosting - a boosted version of my decision tree with pruning
  * Support Vector Machines - two kernel functions
  * k-nearest neighbors

#Testing
  * Design two interesting classification problems. 
  * Training and testing error rates

#Requirements
  * Python 2.7
  * Sklearn
  * matplotlib
  * pylab
  * Kereas


## Note
  * Original datasets are located in Datasets.

# Decision Tree Pruning
  * To get pruned decision tree best parameters for Diabetes set, run decisionTreeDia.py
  * To get pruned decsion tree for SpamBase set, run decisionTreeSpam.py
  * To generate plots and test and training statistics for diabetes set decision trees run driverDia.py and for Spambase run driverSpam.py

# Boosting
  * To run boosted trees, for the diabetes set run adaboostDia.py, for Spambase run adaboostSpam.py

# SVM
  * To run SVM, for the diabetes set run svmDia.py, for Spambase run svmSpam.py

#KNN
  * To run KNN, for the diabetes set run knnDia.py, for Spambase run knnSpam.py

#Neural Networks
  * To run the neural networks, for the diabetes set run kerasDia.py, for Spambase run kerasSpam.py
