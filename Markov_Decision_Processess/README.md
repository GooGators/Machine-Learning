# Purpose
  * Use machine learning in order to allow an agent of some kind to act in the world more directly.
  * Come up with two interesting MDPs.
  * Solve each MDP using value iteration as well as policy iteration.
  
# System Requirements
  * Python 2.7
  * Sklearn
  * matplotlib
  * Pandas
  * Java 1.8
  
## Data
  * I chose to run my tests for each grid world problems with Burlap in Java. I then took the results and graphed them in Python using the libraries listed above.

## Runing Each Test (Java)
  * Located in file burlap/src
### Easy Grid World
  * Run /src: EasyGridWorldLauncher.java
